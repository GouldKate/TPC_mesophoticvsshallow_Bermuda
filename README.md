Thermal Performance Curves between depths in Bermuda

The physiology of ectotherms living in marine environments is strongly influenced by their local thermal experience.
Scleractinian corals living near their thermal optimums are increasingly vulnerable to bleaching and mortality as oceanic heat waves increases globally.
Mesophotic cCoral eEcosystems (MCE’s) below 30m depths are characteristically cooler than adjacent shallow water reefs, which according to theory should 
result in differential metabolic responses to temperature between depths. While mesophotic corals are not immune to thermal stress, how local temperatures
influence physiological responses in these corals is poorly understood. To quantify differences in thermal sensitivities between depths, we compared performance
metrics estimated from thermal performance curves (TPC) obtained from raw metabolic rates across a range of temperatures (19-36 ℃) in four common coral species
(Diploria labyrinthiformis, Orbicella franksi, Montastraea cavernosa, and Porites astreoides) from a shallow (5-10m) and upper-mesophotic (30-35m) site in Bermuda.
While the maximum rate of gross photosynthetic (GP) performance (GP-Pmax), and the mean overall photosynthetic rates (GP-lnc) were found to differ among species, 
no differences in GP thermal metrics (Pmax, Topt, lnc, E, Eh, or Th) were found across depth for conspecifics except deactivation energy (GP-Eh) in D. labyrinthiformis. 
Gross respiration (R) differed among species for Pmax but not across depth for any thermal metric. The indistinguishable metabolic responses across depth indicate
local adaptation and/or acclimatization to different thermal conditions is not occurring. Rather, conspecific corals from shallow and upper-mesophotic reefs have
similar thermal sensitivities suggesting that MCEs in Bermuda have the potential to function as thermal refuges for these four corals’ survival.
